Who We Are
PublicAssets (http://www.PublicAssets.com) is a company that will develop the definitive catalogue of real estate, natural resources, infrastructure, utilities, state owned enterprises, and more owned by local, regional, and national governments around the globe. On top of this catalogue we will develop three lines of business: commercial data services for companies interested in contacting governments and historic/real-time data, marketplaces, and data licensing to third-parties.

Who We're Looking For
We're seeking a technology leader to join at a very early stage to develop and execute our technical roadmap, and develop and lead a highly-functioning world-class team. If this sounds like you and you're looking to help develop a massive global marketplace, can build a highly functional engineering team, and can develop and execute a broad technology strategy (experience with marketplaces is a huge plus), _and_ want to make a huge impact on the world, contact us by sending a note to skip@publicassets.com
