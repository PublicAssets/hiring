<b>The Opportunity</b><br>
The world’s largest aggregation of asset classes—estimated at greater than $300T—remains fragmented, untouched by the Internet, and has most of the attributes of successful marketplaces: <b>public assets</b>. Public assets are what's owned by local, regional, and central governments around the world, including buildings, land, natural resources, infrastructure, utilities, and much more.
<br>
Despite the tremendous value of public assets, most governments don’t publish inventories of the assets they own and manage. With no central inventory of a single government’s assets—much less those held by the hundreds of thousands of governments around the globe—there are stunted, inefficient markets for and serving public assets. Companies interested in transacting with or providing services for governments have no simple way to identify the agencies and contacts with whom to conduct business around public assets. Additionally, researchers, citizens, and the media don’t have transparency into inventories, management, and investment decisions.
<br>
The opportunity to structure, develop, and grow the category of public assets is a large, technology-driven opportunity for financial and social value creation.
<br>
Amazon became an early mover in e-commerce in part because it sold books—a category that was structured with the ISBN catalogue system. Leveraging the ISBN catalogue, Amazon offered an uncluttered, trusted search and browse experience that drove certainty in the buying experience, higher conversion rates, and enabled other features, such as collaborative filtering and recommendations. Similarly, by creating a catalogue of the world’s public assets, stakeholder pain points, including access to data and the development and growth of efficient marketplaces will be addressed.
<br>
<b>Who We Are</b><br>
PublicAssets (http://www.PublicAssets.com) is the company that will aggregate, standardize, enrich, and commercialize broad sets of public asset data. On top of this catalogue we will develop three lines of business: commercial data services for companies interested in contacting governments and historic/real-time data, marketplaces, and data licensing to third-parties.

<b>Who We're Looking For</b><br>
We're seeking a technology leader who wants to unlock tremendous value and make a huge impact on the world. This person will join at a very early stage and will develop and execute our technical roadmap along with a highly-functioning, world-class team. If this sounds like you, send a note to skip@publicassets.com.
